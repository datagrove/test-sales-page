          <blockquote>
          Datagrove is committed to only requesting the data required by Academic Excellence to purchase CAT codes. Our CAT code order form asks users to share the first name, last name, and email of the adult ordering the test codes, and the grade level of the student(s) for whom they are ordering. That's it!
          
          Also, we will never sell your information or send you spam emails. We respect your privacy!

          <summary>**How do I pay for a Datagrove CAT code?**</summary>
          <blockquote>
          Datagrove uses the Stripe payment processing solutions for the purchase of its CAT codes. Stripe is one of the most popular eCommerce solutions for online marketplaces - you've likely made an online purchase using Stripe already! Using Stripe allows Datagrove to offer payment processing that is secure and reliable. Like most card processing services, Stripe does charge a fee for its use, but Datagrove has chosen to pay those fees to make it easier for users to know exactly what to expect for their bottom line. Since the payment process is managed entirely by Stripe, Datagrove will never receive your credit card information.

          <summary>**Why Pawpaw?**</summary>
          <blockquote>
           The pawpaw, scientifically known as Asimina triloba, is a native North American fruit-bearing tree that grows in patches, thriving in specific local environments. Much like homeschooling, which blossoms within the nurturing confines of home and community, the pawpaw finds its optimal growth conditions in specific regions, fostering a sense of belonging and rootedness.

           Unlike widely commercialized fruits, such as apples or oranges, the pawpaw fruit resists mass production and distribution due to its perishable nature.  Similarly, homeschooling emphasizes personalized, locally relevant education tailored to the individual needs of each child.
